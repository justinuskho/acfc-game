In this group activity, you will design the `best restaurant` you can think of.
- You have raised `X` amount of funding from VCs and angel investors.
- You may invest this cash on certain restaurant attributes.
- There are mandatory and wildcard attributes you may invest in:
    - `Mandatory attributes` are core to your business such as Food Quality, Portion Size, Service, Waiting Time, Aesthetics/Ambience
    - `Wildcard attributes` are optional investments that add unique advantages to your business
    - Wildcard attributes are purchased at a flat rate of `W`. Please ensure you have enough cash left upon selecting a wildcard.
- The remaining unused cash amount determines your `Affordability`.
    
    
At the end of the activity, you will have to `pitch` why your restaurant is the best in town! Here's your pitch guide:
- Type of restaurant
- Attributes you invest in & why?
